Taxonomy user manual
====================

`Taxonomy <https://github.com/biblibre/omeka-s-module-Taxonomy>`_ allows to
create controlled vocabularies within Omeka S.

Controlled vocabularies (taxonomies) and controlled vocabulary terms (taxonomy
terms) are Omeka S resources, which means:

* they can be linked to items, item sets and media like any other Omeka S
  resources (they can be linked in annotations too);
* they can be described like any other resources (resource template, class,
  properties, annotations);
* they can have a thumbnail.

Site page block
===============

The "Taxonomy term tree" page block displays all root terms of a taxonomy and
allows users to load a term's children by clicking on the term.
Clicking on a term's title takes them to the taxonomy term page where they can
see the taxonomy term properties and the resources linked to it.

The link and appearance can be customized by themes by overriding
``taxonomy/common/taxonomy-term-jstree-node-text-public.phtml``

To add the "Taxonomy term tree" block to a page, see the official documentation
on `how to edit pages <https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/sites/site_pages/#editing-pages>`_.

Once you added the block to a page you have the ability to select a taxonomy.
Only taxonomy terms that belong to that taxonomy will be displayed.

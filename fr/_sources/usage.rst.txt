Usage
=====

In the admin navigation menu, there is a ``Taxonomies`` link. Click there to
go to the taxonomies list. From there it's possible to create, edit or delete
taxonomies. It's also possible to list a taxonomy terms, and then create, edit
or delete terms for this taxonomy.

Once the taxonomies are created, create/modify a resource template and include
the new data types for the desired properties. Use this resource template when
taxonomies are needed.

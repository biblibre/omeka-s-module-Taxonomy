Taxonomies
==========

A taxonomy is a group of taxonomy terms. It's a way to build a controlled
vocabulary in Omeka S.

A taxonomy is also an Omeka S resource (like items, item sets and media), which
means:

* it can be linked to items, item sets and media like any other Omeka S
  resource (it can be linked in annotations too);
* it can be described like any other resource (resource template, class,
  properties, annotations);
* it can have a thumbnail.

A taxonomy has a unique (among other taxonomies) identifier, called **Code**.

The Taxonomies tab
------------------

Taxonomies are listed in the **Taxonomies** tab (with the tags icon) in the
left-hand navigation of the administrative dashboard.

This page is very similar to `The Items tab
<https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/content/items/#the-items-tab>`_. Please
refer to this documentation for general information.

There are a few differences:

* There is an additional column showing the taxonomy's **Code**.
* Taxonomies can be sorted by **Code**.
* There is an additional icon to **list taxonomy terms** (tag).
